# README for the data directory

## Data Directory Overview

This directory contains all the data used for training and evaluating the Large Language Model (LLM). It is structured into two main subdirectories: `raw` and `processed`.

### Directory Structure

- **raw/**: This folder contains the raw data files that are used as input for the model training and evaluation. The data in this folder is unprocessed and should be kept in its original form.

- **processed/**: This folder contains the processed data files. The data in this folder has undergone preprocessing steps such as tokenization, cleaning, and formatting to make it suitable for model training and evaluation.

### Usage

1. **Raw Data**: Place all raw data files in the `raw/` directory. Ensure that the data is in a format compatible with the preprocessing scripts.

2. **Processed Data**: After running the preprocessing scripts, the cleaned and tokenized data will be saved in the `processed/` directory. This data will be used for training and evaluating the model.

### Important Notes

- Always back up the raw data before processing.
- Ensure that the processed data is validated before using it for training to avoid any issues during model training and evaluation.
